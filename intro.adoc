== Introduction

The Enhanced Trace for RISC-V standard defines packet payloads for instruction and data trace but does not fully define how this should be encapsulated for transport.  Chapter 7 gives some illustrative examples but this is insufficiently detailed and informative only.

Although the primary motivation for developing this standard was to define an encapsulation format for Enhanced Trace for RISC-V packets, the encapsulation format is agnostic to the packet payload structure and meaning and so can be used for any kind of data.  For example: counter metrics, trace or other diagnostic data from a bus fabric monitor or on-chip logic analyser.  It is not restricted to processor trace.  

This specification defines an encapsulation format suitable for use with a variety of transport mechanisms, including but not limited to AMBA Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) and Siemens' Embedded Analytics Messaging Infrastructure.
